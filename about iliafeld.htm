<p>I had final arts orientation at school and also got BA in industrial design + MA in integrated design at HIT, Holon, Israel.</p>
    
<p>A bit about who am I what and I do. First of all: MAKER is the best description of what I want to become. For last decade Iâ€™ve been working on stages as lighting designer, operator and technical director. Mostly I create lighting for ballet and theatre. I have passion for problems solving and for creation of musical objects - luthier from trash. </p>

<p>I see interactions between objects and people, spaces/environments and practices/experiences as a web of choices/connections that have been made often top-down by designers and architects. Sometimes wise and sometime terrible choices.</p> 

<p>For me, Fab Labs have The Vision of how should the education and the prosuming (producing/professional + consuming) look like in current era. This is place that sticks to some values that I find also my personal and professional drives. In FABLAB I push myself from the comfort zone in to great and unknown of learning, growth and creation. I believe that design has to become property of common, not saved for professionals. Designing process has also very powerful educational profits. As environmental/sustainable designer I share my ideas and wish to work in collaboration. </p>
